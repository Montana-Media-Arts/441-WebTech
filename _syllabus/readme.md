# Technology, tools, and required software

#### JavaScript
We will spend the first portion of the semester digging into coding with JavaScript. This is a general language that is used for scripting in browsers.

#### node.js
Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine. Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.

#### Databases - MySQL
We will also work with databases this semester, including MySQL, which is a relational database used throughout web development.

## Server Hosting
You are expected to use an appropriate hosting solution for your work this semester. You will be encouraged to use [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com). Assuming you have not already done so, you may be able to use this service for free for one year. Regardless, you will be responsible for acquiring server space/time and if the free option does not work, you will be required to purchase services through Amazon or BlueHost. This will be coered in class, but do prepare financially for this neccessary course component.




# Policies

### Homework
We will have a number of assignments throughout the course of the semester. These assignments are required and you should be prepared to show/talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a GitHub.com repo and eventually Amazon Web Services account for their assignments.

### Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. Please inform your teacher via email if you are going to miss a class. Two unexcused absences is cause for failing the class. (An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2 an absence.)

### Participation
This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and through the digital portals.

### Exam
There will be a course exam that will occur approximatly 3/4's of the way into the course. This will coer topics ranging from basic math, coding techniques, directory organization, problem solving, and understanding of concepts. You will have at least 3-weeks notice as to the exact date of the exam. The exam will take an entire class period.

### Final Project
Class will culminate with final projects. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the class that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world.

### Assessment
Grades will be based primarily on the student’s ability to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of the specific characteristics and integrative capabilities of the assigned topic in your own words and code.
2. Articulate a clear and concise perspective. Cutting and pasting or copying word for word off the Internet will result in loss of points.
3. Present an organized file/program, as well as blog entry; including proper and punctual delivery of the assignment files.
4. Demonstrate creativity beyond the expected technical requirements.

IMPORTANT: Assignments handed in after the due date and time will have points deducted for lateness. This will be in addition to any points deducted for content. Those that are uploaded late but within one week of the due date will lose 1 point for lateness.  For those uploaded after that, the number of deducted points will be at the discretion of the faculty.


### Grade Break Down   
Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

* Regular Assignments 50%
* Participation and Attendance 20%
* Exam 10%
* Final Project 20%

Letter Break Downs;

- A   94-100
- A-  90-94
- B+  87-90
- B   83-87
- B-  80-83
- C+  77-80
- C   73-77
- C-  70-73
- D   60-69
- F   0-59

Grades will be posted in your class moodle shell.


## Academic Misconduct and the Student Conduct Code

All students must practice academic honesty. Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or disciplinary sanction by the University. All students need to be familiar with the Student Conduct Code. The Code is available online at http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/student\_conduct.php

All work must be your own. Plagarism will be considered unaccaptable. You are free to work together, but you must help each other come up with unique solutions in such cases.

## Changes to the Course
I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.
