// Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions.
// For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
// For numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5, the program should print out "FizzBuzz"
// (Your program should still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
//
// Your program should output something like the following;
/*
