/*
HW-4; part 2
SHELL VARIABLE PRINTING

Directions: Write an application that can parse input variables supplied with the node call and print these to the console. This app should be capable of discarding flags (i.e. `-f` and/or `--flag`) and only printing the proceeding variables, each on their own line.

Furthermore, your app should be looking for a "message" flag signified by "`-m`". The value following this flag should be printed last, regardless of where it comes in the input variable sequence and should have a blank line above it.

When I test this app, I will include a number of values proceeded by flags (i.e. `--flag "some value"`).
