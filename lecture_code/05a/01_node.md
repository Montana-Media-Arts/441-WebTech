# Servers & Node.js

What is a server?

- Technically, a server is a program or device that provides functionality for other programs/devices, called "clients". [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing))
- A web server is simply described as a program that dispenses web pages as they are requested. [[2]](http://whatismyipaddress.com/web-server)
- A server is a machine that is connected to the internet.
- When a client machine requests a specific website, a DNS translates the requested internet domain and host name to an IP address. [[3]](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-domain-name-system-816295)
- The clients request is then further directed to the specific IP address associated with the URL. This unique IP address is the desired physical servers.
- The server then sends back the requested files or resources to the client computer, which then translates that data into a viewable and reactive web page.


# Server Languages

Programming for servers has typically involved using languages such as;

- PHP
- Java
- Python
- C

JavaScript is a different language from all of the above, as it is a "non-blocking", "event based" language.

# Callback Functions

With JavaScript, code does not have to finish executing before the next line can be executed. Instead, we can program in "callback functions". A callback function is a registered function that gets "called" when something happens (or finished happening). That function then executes.
